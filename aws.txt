AWS (Amazon Web Services) is the world's leading cloud computing platform, 
offering on-demand access to a vast range of IT resources like computing power, 
storage, and databases over the internet with a pay-as-you-go model, 
allowing businesses to scale instantly and reduce costs compared to managing their own physical infrastructure. 
It functions as a massive, global IT rental service, providing everything from basic servers to advanced AI and analytics, 
managed by Amazon. SQS was the very first service created.
